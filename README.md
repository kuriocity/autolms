Tired of doing the boring stuff by clikcing?
Automate it using Python Script by Seleinum and PyautoGUI!
Some quizes and Assignment upload needs to be done manaully.(Will be working on that too)
But most of the work is easily done in a snap!
You can get the whole Sourcecode here which you can mess with :)
Just make sure Chromedriver is in the same folder the python file is in
also import selenium and pyautogui if not installed, type 'pip install selenium,pyautogui' in command prompt if path is set.
After the script runs,enter your email id of lms and then password when promepted and hit Enter!
BOOM!
Watch your screen flashing with tabs opening and closing :)
